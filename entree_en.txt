Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by mountains, there lived a kind-hearted old man.
Every morning, he would walk to the river, carrying a basket of fruits for the birds.
The villagers loved him because he always shared stories about his travels across the world.

One day, a young boy asked him, "Why do you feed the birds every day?"
The old man smiled and said, "Because they remind me of the freedom I once had when I traveled."
Even though his traveling days were over, he found joy in the simple act of giving.

The birds would chirp happily, and the river would sing along.
His kindness spread throughout the village, inspiring others to be more caring
